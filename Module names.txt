Module names
Code modules are generally named after the chapter titles, and not the chapter numbers, which sometimes make them difficult to find. Here is the list of the modules:

Chapter 1: fpinjava-introduction

Chapter 2: fpinjava-usingfunctions

Chapter 3: fpinjava-makingjavafunctional

Chapter 4: fpinjava-recursion

Chapter 5: fpinjava-lists

Chapter 6: fpinjava-optionaldata

Chapter 7: fpinjava-handlingerrors

Chapter 8: fpinjava-advancedlisthandling

Chapter 9: fpinjava-laziness

Chapter 10: fpinjava-trees

Chapter 11: fpinjava-advancedtrees

Chapter 12: fpinjava-state

Chapter 13: fpinjava-io

Chapter 14: fpinjava-actors

Chapter 15: fpinjava-applications

Most modules exist in two versions: exercises and solutions. However, chapters 1 (fpinjava-introduction), 14 (fpinjava-actors) and 15 (fpinjava-applications) have no exercises.

Most modules have unit tests that may be run to verify that your solutions to exercises are correct. However, chapter 13 has not unit tests. Instead, all packages in this chapter have executable programs that may be run to verify that the output corresponds to what is expected.
